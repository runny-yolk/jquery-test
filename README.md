# jquery-test
A test I was given by a potential employer, to change a site's (this one: https://www.butlins.com/latest-offers/prices.aspx ) style with JS or jQuery, according to a spec I was given. You copy + paste it into the console, my code does the rest, and integrates with existing functionality of the site to keep the style applied when the filter is changed.

This is also the first jQuery I've written, but as a fast learner and decent JS developer, it came out well.
