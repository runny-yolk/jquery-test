# jquery-test
A test I was given by a potential employer, to change a site's (this one: https://www.butlins.com/latest-offers/prices.aspx ) style with JS or jQuery. You copy + paste it into the console, my code does the rest, and integrates with existing functionality of the site to keep the style applied when the filter is changed.
